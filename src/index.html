                        Hi — I’m <strong>Lokesh Das</strong>, a sophomore in computer science and engineering.
                        I love problem-solving and the math. I have a passion for coding and an incredible interest in problem-solving.
                        </p>

                        <p style="font-size: larger;">
                            As a Research Assistant, I optimize machine learning pipelines.
                            I also serve as the Coding Lead for the Miner Baja team, where I build data systems for our vehicle.
                            I have created a working GPS speedometer with Arduino and am now developing a wireless system for live sensor data.
                            Please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
                        </p>
